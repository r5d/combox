**** DONE use os.path.expanduser to get user's home directory			 :b#1:
	 CLOSED: [2015-04-09 Thu 17:21]

	   Done. But I'm not sure if fix the issue in Windows though.
	 At present os.getenv('HOME') is used to get the user's home
	 directory; This does not seem to work on Windows[1].

	 Thanks to Dr. Green for finding this.

**** DONE combox not handling temprorary files created by editors properly :b#2:
     CLOSED: [2015-09-29 Tue 14:15]
     - CLOSING NOTE [2015-09-29 Tue 14:15] \\
       Done.
**** TODO config has problems creating nested node directories           :b#3:
**** DONE NodeDirMonitor.on_modified assums shard 0 is always available :b#4:
     CLOSED: [2015-08-25 Tue 23:21]
     - CLOSING NOTE [2015-08-25 Tue 23:21] \\
       Fixed this. Now it checks if all shards are available before
       doing decrypt and glue.
     This is not always the case.
*** functionality
**** DONE combox does not move shards properly                          :b#5:
     When a file is moved/renamed to a place in different directory,
     combox does not corresponding move/rename shards.

     - CLOSING NOTE [2015-09-12 Sat 20:18] \\
       Done.
**** DONE directory rename does not delete old directory on remote computer. :b#6:
     This is happending because the files inside the directory are
     going through a delayed deletion.
     CLOSED: [2015-09-12 Sat 22:20]
     - CLOSING NOTE [2015-09-12 Sat 22:20] \\
       Done.

     The solution will be to do a delayed deletion of the old directory path.
**** DONE combox.file.rm_path fails when a non-existent file is given   :b#7:

     - CLOSING NOTE [2015-10-16 Fri 19:37] \\
       Fixed it.

**** DONE combox has problems handling large files                     :b#10:
     CLOSED: [2015-11-13 Fri 09:18]
     Large files (500MiB say) are not getting written properly in combox directory.

     CLOSED: [2015-11-19 Thu 08:36]
     This class must be modified to use the same the Lock that the
     node monitors are using.

	- This is not release critical. So, I'm going not going to focus

      the node directories.
