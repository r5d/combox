	interface for configuring combox; it rough as zark.

2015-11-19 Siddharth Ravikumar <sravik@bgsu.edu>

	* combox/events.py: ComboxDirMonitor now uses Lock; now this Lock
	is shared by both the ComboxDirMonitor and the NodeDirMonitors.

	Files changed because of the change to ComboxDirMonitor: combox/cbox.py

	This changed addresses bug#11 (See TODO.org).

2015-11-13 Siddharth Ravikumar <sravik@bgsu.edu>

	bumping to v0.1.3

2015-11-08 Siddharth Ravikumar <sravik@bgsu.edu>

	* combox/events.py: ComboxDirMonitor and NodeDirMonitor now keep
	track of the files that are created during "this" run; this
	information is used to ignore the on_modified event triggered by
	watchdog when a file is created.

	Also, a delay proportional to the size of the file is introduced
	on the on_modified callback methods of the ComboxDirMonitor and
	NodeDirMonitor to prevent multiple on_modified from being
	triggered by watchdog.

	These changes are related to bug#10 (See TODO.org).

	* tests/events_test.py: updated correponding tests.
